script also in the script editor. The JS script would be something like:</p><pre class="screen">var server = TacticServerStub.get();
var rtn = server.execute_python_script('folder/python_script', kwargs)
// You can pass in kwargs, a dictionary of variables you want to pass in the python script</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Is it possible to run an external python script not in Tactic but on the server?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: One way to do this is to have a UI element activate a JS script in TACTIC,
which calls a python script in TACTIC, which opens a python subprocess to run your external script.</p><p>1) Define a JS script in TACTIC’s script editor, the purpose of which is to run a python
script also in the script editor. The JS script would be something like:</p><pre class="screen">var server = TacticServerStub.get();
var rtn = server.execute_python_script('folder/python_script')</pre><p>2) Define a python script, called <span class="emphasis"><em>folder/python_script</em></span> in this example,
which calls your external python script via the command line. Ex:</p><pre class="screen">import subprocess
subprocess.call(["python", "/tmp/test.py"])</pre><p>If your external script is supposed to return something, you can read the output with syntax similar to this:</p><pre class="screen">  import subprocess
  popen = subprocess.Popen('python', '/tmp/test.py'], shell=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
  popen.wait()
  output = ''
  value = popen.communicate()
  if value:
    output = value[0].strip()
    if not output:
      err = value[1]
      print err
  return output</pre><p>In doing so, the JS script will also have the return value stored in the variable "rtn".</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>:  How to load an external js file in custom layout editor. Where can you save the js file?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: You can  include some external js and make use of some of its key functions immediately
in the same call, you are required to put function definition within that function() { } block.</p><p>In the HTML:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class="my_class"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>In the behavior:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;behavior class="my_class" event="load"&gt;
var js_files = [
"/assets/file_name_1.js", “/assets/file_name_2.js”
];
spt.dom.load_js(js_files , function() {
   // you can call functions defined in those js files path
require; define; // require, define are functions defined in those js_files path
}
&lt;/behavior&gt;</pre><p>You can save the js file in tactic, there are three ways to do that:
a) To get it working locally: you can put it in spt_js (not recommended because it is in TACTIC code), and load using:</p><pre class="screen">spt.dom.load_js(['/context/spt_js/file_name.js'], function() {</pre><p>b) You could also put it temporarily in the assets folder(This is mapped in apache to /assets/…) and load through:</p><pre class="screen">spt.dom.load_js(['/assets/file_name.js'], function() {</pre><p>c)  Create a plugin and put it in the plugin folder.  The plugin folder is mapped /plugins/…</p><pre class="screen">spt.dom.load_js(['mapped /plugins/file_name.js'], function() {</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: How do you load the item into a new tab as opposed to the main body?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: To load the item into a new tab as opposed to the main body, you need to call:</p><pre class="screen">spt.tab.set_main_body_tab();
spt.tab.add_new(element_name, tab_title, class_name, kwargs);</pre><p>The tab code and function can be found in "src/tactic/ui/container/tab_wdg.py"</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: How do you add a new tab when there are multiple sets of tabs that can be added to?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: If there are multiple sets of tabs (ex: a dashboard of tabs under a tab), you can decide which set to add a new tab to with code similar to the following:</p><pre class="screen">var tabs_el = bvr.src_el.getElement(".spt_tab_top");
if (tabs_el) {
  spt.tab.set_tab_top(tabs_el)
  spt.tab.add_new(element_name, tab_title, class_name, kwargs);</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: How to load a specific view into the current tab?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>:</p><pre class="screen">var title = "Ticket List";
var view = "ticket_list";
var search_type = "scrum/ticket";

var kwargs = {
  'view': 'ticket_list',
  'search_type': 'scrum/ticket'
}

var class_name = "tactic.ui.panel.ViewPanelWdg";

spt.tab.set_main_body_tab();
spt.tab.load_selected(view, title, class_name, kwargs);</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Can you load a json file in Tactic through custom layout editor? Where can we save the file?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Yes you can, using :</p><pre class="screen">spt.json(“file_path”, function( )) {</pre><p>in a behavior (as this is a javascript function)</p><p>In TACTIC, the json file can be anywhere that is mapped by Apache. TACTIC
does have /assets mapped and /plugins (if you want to create a plugin). The
easiest way is just to create a folder in /assets and then use that path.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Say you have a custom script in the script editor to "centralize"
some code. How can you can call it from a number of different custom layout views.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: We don’t have a great mechanism for this because it has to go to
the server to get the script every time.  It doesn’t cache the code on the
server.  We have generally used .js files for central Javascript functions.</p><p>We do have some code that is outside the api that may help in
src/context/spt_s/custom_project.js
but it is not part of our API.  We might map that into our API at some point,
however, it will help you in the short run:</p><p>1)</p><pre class="screen">var script = spt.CustomProject.get_script_by_path("test/my_script")
var ret_val = eval(script);</pre><p>This will return the last evaluated variable in "script".</p><p>2) We do have another function:</p><pre class="screen">spt.CustomProject.run_script_by_path(")</pre><p>but it does a straight eval, which doesn’t have an assumed return
value, so the first example is the best bet.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: How can you connect sobjects automatically based on dependencies. Say
when you create new asset all those process(Task) should be connected automatically
based on pipeline.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>:  The "connection" table in sthpw database is mainly used for arbitrary
connections between sobjects.  It is a generalized mechanism and not specific to
tasks: for example, it allows media to be attached to jobs or reference images attached
 to shots.  It can be used to "connect" tasks together to show a dependency, but we
 have never used it as such.</p><p>It can be accomplished using a trigger and the script, but this is not the best way
store task dependency as a default. Data should be stored somewhere (ie: the depend_id
column may be too simple given the complexities of pipelines)  At this point, TACTIC
doesn’t have a built-in generalized solution for this.  This is definitely something
that can be discussed and we can incorporate into the development schedule.</p><p>So for now, you can do this by having triggers. So say you can have an event for inserting
a new shot/asset which will run a script where you can create tasks and connect them to the sobject.</p><p>You can look into triggers :

<a class="ulink" href="http://community.southpawtech.com/python-client-api_general_insert.html" target="_top">http://community.southpawtech.com/python-client-api_general_insert.html</a></p><p>Connect sobjects:
<a class="ulink" href="http://community.southpawtech.com/python-client-api_general_connect_sobjects.html" target="_top">http://community.southpawtech.com/python-client-api_general_connect_sobjects.html</a></p><p>The example below might be helpful and JS script code will roughly be something similar:</p><pre class="screen">var search_type = 'project/table_name';
      var sobject = server.insert(search_type, data);
      // Create a corresponding task.
      task_type = "sthpw/task";
      var task = server.insert(task_type, task_data, { parent_key.__search_key__} );
      server.connect_sobjects(sobject, task, {context: "main_task"});</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Load modes for CustomLayoutWdg ?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: We added two load modes to the CustomLayoutWdg available in Tactic 4.1+</p><pre class="screen">&lt;element view="my_view" load="async"/&gt;
&lt;element view="my_view2" load="async"/&gt;
&lt;element view="my_view3" load="async"/&gt;
&lt;element view="my_view4" load="async"/&gt;

&lt;element view="my_view" load="sequence"/&gt;
&lt;element view="my_view2" load="sequence"/&gt;
&lt;element view="my_view3" load="sequence"/&gt;
&lt;element view="my_view4" load="sequence"/&gt;</pre><p>With "async", all will be loaded simultaneously.  With "sequence",
the will be loaded sequentially, meaning one load will not start
until the other finishes.  You can mix and match:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;element view="my_view"/&gt;
&lt;element view="my_view2" load="async"/&gt;
&lt;element view="my_view3" load="sequence"/&gt;
&lt;element view="my_view4" load="sequence"/&gt;</pre><p>Here, #1, will be loaded with the page, #2 and 3 will be loaded
together (the first sequence item starts immediately with async)
and then #4 is loaded after #3 is finished.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: When you use expression in the column definition , can you pass sobject information explicitly?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Yes, if the mode_expr is "relative". The parent_wdg of a column is TableLayoutWdg and
for a row in a an edit pop up, the parent_wdg is EditWdg. You can pass in a search_key explicitly
if there is no parent_wdg and search_key(search key doesn’t exist for insert_search_key).</p><p>In the source code we have something like:</p><pre class="screen">if mode_expr == 'relative':
                sobjects = my.sobjects
                if not sobjects:
                   parent_wdg = my.get_parent_wdg()
                        if parent_wdg:
                        # use the search_key as a starting point if applicable
                        sk = parent_wdg.kwargs.get('search_key')
                        if sk:
                          sobjects = [Search.get_by_search_key(sk)]
                        else:
                        sk = my.kwargs.get('search_key')
                        if sk:
                            sobjects = [Search.get_by_search_key(sk)]</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Can we pass sobject information through the column definition as an argument or
parameter to the js script being called in it?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Not at the moment</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: In the edit mode, can you call a JS script?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Yes. Pass the script location as an argument</p><pre class="screen"> &lt;element name="element_name" edit_script="JS Script Location"&gt;
  &lt;display class="SelectWdg"&gt;
        &lt;empty&gt;true&lt;/empty&gt;
  &lt;/display&gt;
&lt;/element&gt;</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Can you retrieve sobject informations in the script called through edit_script ?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: We can’t use bvr.search_key because the source code doesn’t pass it in. This is a limitation at the moment.
Passing bvr information here would be difficult.  There are many places where this function is called,
each with different behaviors.</p><p>However, the "cell" is available to this method, so you can do:</p><pre class="screen">var row = spt.table.get_row_by_cell(cell);
var search_key = row.getAttribute("spt_search_key");</pre><p>There are inconsistencies where it’s basically random what a script receives.  At some point, we should conglomerate and standardize all of that.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: In the view mode, can you call a JS script for a button widget?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Yes. Pass the script location as</p><pre class="screen">&lt;script_path&gt;js file location&lt;/script_path&gt;</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Can you retrieve sobject information in the script passed as script_path
in view mode for button widget?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Yes using var search_key = bvr.search_key in JS script</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: How can you add constraints to fields using Tactic?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>:  For input validation refer to page 65 of the developer docs:

can have as many column values)
For example:</p><pre class="screen">@SUBSTITUTE((%0.d - %s ….),@GET(table_name/column_name), @GET(table_name/column_name),...)</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: How can you create an expression column that uses the data from the current row and matches this against the full database?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>:
1.  Send the id of the current sobject in the current table table to get a certain column and look for columns related to that in another table Table2</p><pre class="screen">@COUNT(oss_assets/table2['base_product', @GET(oss_assets/table1['id',$SOBJECT_ID].col_name)])</pre><p>Note: Only available on Tactic 4.1+</p><p>However this expression will still run in absolute mode and it will be way slower and will only work for
table expressions. . Here in this case, you don’t need to mention the mode. But its use will still be
limited as it doesn’t have the capability of dealing with the case you mentioned(matching first five
characters). It works for matching only equal strings.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
Better way is to use python widget and add a script path and write a python script for that.
</li></ol></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: How to get a list of parents for a list of task sobjects using API?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>:
To get a list of tasks:</p><pre class="screen">tasks = server.eval("@SOBJECT(sthpw/task['search_type','film/shot?project=XYZ'])")</pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">

However for single task , you can also use:
</li></ol></div><pre class="screen">server.get_parent(task.get('__search_key__'))</pre><p>Avoid looping to get the list of parents for a task list. Use the previous expression for better speed
in this case.

It is passed
in through the "input" variable. There is an example here:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://community.southpawtech.com/content/how-write-python-trigger-tactic-script-editor" target="_top">http://community.southpawtech.com/content/how-write-python-trigger-tactic-script-editor</a></p><p>Task.py does have some convenience functions, but it is not necessarily called to create every task.
The Task class is a wrapper class derived from SObject. Many functions will just use the lower level
SObject functionality to create tasks. Modifying the Task.py class is not going to get what you want
because these just contain helper functions that are sometimes convenient to use. A trigger is the
proper place to do what you want to do because it will be called every time an event occurs . In this
case "insert|sthpw/task" will be called <span class="strong"><strong>every</strong></span> time a task is inserted. You can get the info the need
as specified in the doc link above.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: How do you add a new button to the task view(which is in asset and shot of project vfx),
but in "Manage sTypes" ?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: You can do that in any task view, like project tasks, right click on the column header and
choose "create new column ". You have a choice for button widget there.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: How can you customize weekends?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: As of Tactic 4.1, we only support customizing the display for weekend in the Gantt Element
Widget and you can’t modify the number of working days. Its hard coded to 5days default. For display,
you can pick the start of the week using the Edit Column Manager and it will automatically set the two
previous days as weekend. So say you choose start day as Monday, then weekends are Saturday and Sunday.
If you choose start day as Wednesday, then weekend is Monday and Tuesday.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/gannt_chart_edit_column_definition.png" alt="image" /></span></p><p>Work Element Widget(work hour column in the table) and has nothing to do with Gantt Element Widget
(task Schedule column). However, the work element widget still doesn’t support the flexible weekends
and its not linked to Gantt Element widget in any way. Its only the Gantt Element widget that we modified
for customizing weekends. So if you modify the weekends in the Gantt element widget, they won’t be reflected
in the Work Element Widget.
Unfortunately , at this point we don’t support it for Work Element Widget.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Is there is any translation for other languages for TACTIC UI?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>:  There are two interfaces in Tactic:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
<span class="strong"><strong>Administrative interface</strong></span>: This interface supports only English at the moment and it requires
some work to "internationalize" in order to accommodate other languages.
</li><li class="listitem">
<span class="strong"><strong>Interface built using Custom layout editor (available in TACTIC 4.0+)</strong></span>: This interface can be themed
with any load and feel in any language.
</li></ol></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Is there a way to clone/copy a project in Tactic?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Yes, you can use Template projects. If a project wasn’t made a template at the
time of creation follow the steps below:</p><p>→ Go under Projects and select the Template option under Is Template column for the project
you wish to clone and hit save
→ Go under the Template Projects and update the Template by Clicking the Update icon under Update column.
→ The project you made the template of should appear in the option. Use the this project template
when you create the new project( <a class="ulink" href="http://community.southpawtech.com/tactic-setup_setup_create-new-project.html" target="_top">http://community.southpawtech.com/tactic-setup_setup_create-new-project.html</a>).
It will be a copy of that project.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Note</strong></span>: Template projects don’t copy the data, just the configuration.  If you want to the full data,
the best is to just dump the database and import it on another server.  You shouldn’t do tests on a production server.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_questions_related_to_videos_and_file_checkins"></a>1.4. Questions related to videos and file checkins</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Checkin files under vfx project and generate the thumbnail
using the generate_video_thumbnail script using FFMPEG?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: There are a few issues with generate_video_thumbnail script.</p><p>What to check for:</p><p>1) the thumb_path variable is hardcoded to a folder which doesn’t exist. We generally
use the "get_tmp_dir" from Tactic’s Environment class (under pyasm/common) method to get
a temporary folder to use for operations like this instead.</p><p>2) The path variable gets the incorrect path. add the mode="lib" argument to the
get_path_from_snapshot function for the server path.</p><p>3) Even with the above, FFMPEG won’t generate the temporary thumbnail because the script is buggy.
You need go through FFMPEG documentation and fix the script.</p><p>Alternate solution is to not use the script. In that case,  the checkin happens fine but the thumbnail has to be generated separately.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_tactic_table_related_questions"></a>1.5. Tactic Table Related Questions</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Question</strong></span>: How can you disable the edit option for a column?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: For this there are 2 options:</p><p>1) For the column, Edit the column definition and in the edit tab, un-check edit which will disallow editing in the table and remove the code field from the edit view.</p><p>2) If you edit the column definition, in the edit tab make sure the widget is set to TextWdg.

So the basic example would be:</p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(parent.sthpw/note)</pre><p>This will get all notes for the parent.  To filter, it will depend on where they are using the expression but it will be something like:</p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(parent.sthpw/note['process', @GET(.process)])</pre><p>The @GET(.process) in the filter will get the process value from the relative sObject (the task in this case) or
If in code and the process is known:</p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(parent.sthpw/note['process', 'something'])</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_new_features_tactic_4_2"></a>1.7. New features TACTIC 4.2:</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>i. Ability to set multiple sandboxes and multiple repo locations</strong></span></p><p>We have added the ability to set multiple sandboxes and multiple repo locations.
They can be set for any naming convention using the sandbox_dir_alias and base_dir_alias
columns in the naming table.  The values are "aliases" to the file-system, making it easy
to systems people to remap to other base folders.  The sandbox_dir_alias column can contain "|"
separated values to provide an optional list of sandboxes to work in.  Alternatively "<span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>"
will list all of the available paths and leaving it empty will use "default".  It is backwards
compatible so former configurations with just the value will work as before.  You can see this
optional selection in the check-in/out widget.</p><p>An example for config setting is shown below:</p><pre class="screen">    &lt;asset_base_dir&gt;{
        "default": "/home/tactic/assets",

    }&lt;/asset_base_dir&gt;
